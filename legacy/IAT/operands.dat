# This file contains all x86 operands in the following format
# operand_value, test/ignore, operand_type
# Legend:
#   operand_value = The value of the operand when output to an assembly file
#   test/ignore = "test" to generate tests for this operand
#                 "ignore" to not load this operand into the Test Generator
#   operand_type = The type of the operand and its size
